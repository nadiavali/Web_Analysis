# A/B Testing Analysis Project

In today's competitive business landscape, data-driven decision-making is essential for success. This project focuses on one critical technique: analyzing A/B test data.

## Methods for Introducing New Solutions

There are two primary methods for introducing new solutions on a platform:

1. **Implementation Followed by Performance Analysis**: Implement the technology and then analyze its performance.
2. **A/B Testing**: Divide users into two groups:
   - **Group A (Control Group)**: Experiences the platform without changes.
   - **Group B (Test Group)**: Experiences the platform with new features.

This approach allows businesses to assess whether the changes are beneficial and should be applied universally. Correctly analyzing A/B test data and drawing accurate conclusions is crucial.

## Core of This Project

- Implement A/B tests effectively.
- Analyze test results accurately.
- Make informed decisions based on data.
